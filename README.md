# Field-Survey

Description: This application uses model-view-controller (MVC) where the model is based on javascript object notation (JSON) data from a field survey. The user interface is a table view with entries from the field survey where the table view cells have a layout based on a custom cell design. When the user taps a cell in the Table View a segue leads the user to another view controller that displays information (a detail view) about the field survey entry (an observation). For navigation between the table view and the detail view a navigation controller is used.

Purpose: This app provides experience working with a navigation controller, view controllers, table views, segues, custom table view cells, enumerations, dates, data structures, MVC architecture, creating an app model, parsing javascript object notation, icons, and image resources.
